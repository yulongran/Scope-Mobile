## I Project Overview

The project Scope is a mobile application that can be used by instructor or school to provide studentâ€™s performance review based on sets of project requirements.


#### Problem or Opportunity

The majority of the student's project assessment is relying on the instructor. In a real industry, it is common practice to evaluate a team member's work with a performance review to identify strengths, weaknesses, and establish goals for the future. The absence of a student's project evaluation system limits the growth and opportunities for the students.

#### Solution

The Scope will provide a mobile application platform that can be used by schools, instructors, or students to evaluate team members' performance and utilize historical review data for the future. The Scope shall bring a new opportunity for improvement and growth among students and instructors.
